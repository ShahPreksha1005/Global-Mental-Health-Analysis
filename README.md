# Global Mental Health Analysis

This project analyzes mental illness prevalence across different countries and years, providing insights into trends and relationships between various mental disorders. Using univariate and bivariate analysis, this project explores data distributions, key correlations, and applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to uncover underlying patterns in the data.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Mental health data from 1990 to 2019, covering 6420 records and 8 features, including country, year, and prevalence rates of disorders like depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.
- **Objective**: To perform a detailed analysis of mental illness burden, explore key trends across years and regions, and identify major contributing factors through dimensionality reduction.

## Key Components

### Data Exploration
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations provide an initial understanding of numerical and categorical variables.
- Data includes entity names, country codes, and disorder-specific prevalence rates.

### Univariate Analysis
- Examines distribution and central tendency of individual variables using histograms, box plots, and density plots.
- Frequency tables and bar charts summarize categorical variables.

### Bivariate Analysis
- Visualizes relationships between variable pairs using scatter plots, box plots, and violin plots.
- Correlation heatmap highlights associations between numerical variables.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Reduces dimensionality using PCA to identify main components explaining the variance in the dataset.
- Conventional and scikit-learn methods applied, with explained variance ratio helping determine optimal components for analysis.

## Insights and Findings
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of mental health trends globally and serves as a foundation for further modeling or predictive analysis on mental health data.

## Future Directions
Potential next steps could include:
- Applying predictive modeling techniques to forecast mental illness trends.
- Exploring regional variations and factors contributing to mental health burdens.
